We will also explain the benefits and risks of using KRT, and provide some alternatives if you prefer a different solution.
 
## What is Kaspersky Reset Trial (KRT)?
 
Kaspersky Reset Trial (KRT) is a free trial reset tool from Russia that can reset the activation state of Kaspersky products and allow you to use them for free indefinitely. It supports all the latest versions of Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Internet Security, Total Security, PURE, Endpoint Security, and more.
 
KRT works by replacing the trial keys of Kaspersky products with new ones every time you run it. This way, you can activate the trial version of Kaspersky products as many times as you want and enjoy their full functionality without paying anything.
 
## How to Download and Use KRT?
 
Before you download and use KRT, you should know that it is not an official tool from Kaspersky, and it may violate their terms of service. Therefore, you should use it at your own risk and discretion. Also, you should always download KRT from a trusted source, such as AppNee[^1^], to avoid malware or viruses.
 
Here are the steps to download and use KRT:
 
1. Disable the self-defense feature of your Kaspersky product. You can do this by going to Settings > Additional > Self-Defense and unchecking the box.
2. Exit your Kaspersky product by right-clicking on its icon in the system tray and selecting Exit.
3. Download KRT from AppNee[^1^] or another trusted source. You can choose between the portable version or the installer version.
4. Run KRT as administrator. If you downloaded the portable version, just extract it and run the executable file. If you downloaded the installer version, follow the installation wizard and launch it from the Start menu.
5. Click on Activation Reset in the main window of KRT. A pop-up window will ask you to confirm if you want to restart your computer. Click Yes.
6. After your computer restarts, open your Kaspersky product and click on Activate Trial Version of the Application in the activation window. Enter 2222-2222-2222-222U as the trial key (for PURE 3.0, skip this step).
7. Enjoy your extended trial period of Kaspersky products. You can repeat this process whenever your trial expires.
